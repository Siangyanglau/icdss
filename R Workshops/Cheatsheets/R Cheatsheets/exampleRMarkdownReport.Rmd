This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

In short, markdown is a great way of weaving together analysis and reporting. We can do a whole range of things:

# Create titles
## Subtitles
### Sub-sub-titles

1. Numbered
1. Lists
1. Are
1. Easy


In line equations:

$Sepal.Length = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\times$$Sepal.Width + \beta_{2}\times$$Species$ 

Section dividers are simple:

***

* Bullets 
* Are
* Easy, too.
    * Even with indendation!

R code chunks can be incorporated like this:

```{r results='markup', warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(meanWidth = mean(Sepal.Width)) %>%
  kable()

text <- "You can even assign variables and call them out in the text with in-line R code!"

```

You can do anything in a code chunk that you would do in "normal" R. 

`r I(text)`


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = Sepal.Width, data = iris, facets = Species ~ ., fill = Species) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
